# Projects

## Mysteries of Tupni
**Platform:** Unreal Engine 5 | **Language:** Blueprints | **Release:** Itch.io  
A third-person action-adventure dungeon crawler where I led level design and programming efforts. My contributions included:
- **Level design & environment scripting:** Created modular level layouts and interactive elements.
- **Combat system:** Implemented player attacks, enemy AI, and damage mechanics.
- **Game progression:** Designed quest triggers, scripted cutscenes, and integrated dialogue systems.
- **Inventory system:** Developed a functional inventory with item pickups, weapon switching, and consumable tracking.

## Ginger Shroom Journey
**Platform:** Unity | **Language:** C# | **Release:** Steam  
Ginger Shroom Journey is a fully released 2D adventure game built in Unity. I was responsible for core gameplay programming, level design, UI implementation, and optimization. Key contributions include:
- **Character movement & physics:** Implemented smooth movement and collision handling.
- **Interactable objects:** Developed event-driven interactions and environmental triggers.
- **Game UI:** Created menus, HUD elements, and polished UI interactions.
- **Steam integration:** Handled publishing processes and store presence.

## Doors n' Dice
**Platform:** Unreal Engine 5 | **Language:** Blueprints | **Release:** Itch.io  
A unique 2D platformer integrating elements of chance, where players roll dice to determine their path forward. My technical work involved:
- **Dice-based decision mechanics:** Implemented logic for randomized player choices.
- **Interactive door blueprints:** Developed dynamic doors with multiple outcomes (progression, traps, challenges).
- **Death and respawn system:** Created a system for handling hazards and player resets.
- **Enemy AI:** Scripted patrolling enemies and interactive hazards.
- **Game physics adjustments:** Refined player movement for better responsiveness.

## Additional Projects
Beyond these major projects, I have worked on several smaller games that reinforce different aspects of my programming expertise:

- **Crimson Eclipse** (Unreal Engine 5 | 2D Side-Scroller Horror): Implemented enemy AI, interactive environment elements, game logic, and dynamic HUD elements.
- **Escape Control** (Unreal Engine 5 | Top-Down Sci-Fi Shooter): UI Widget Construction & Blueprinting, Programming Menus.
- **Various Game Jams**: Participated in rapid prototyping cycles, experimented with new game mechanics, and collaborated on diverse projects with small to medium sized teams (3-10 people).

These projects exhibit my technical knowledge in Unreal Engine 5 and Unity, with exceptional skills in Blueprints, C#, game mechanics programming, UI development, and level design.
