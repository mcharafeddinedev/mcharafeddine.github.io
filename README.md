# Projects

## Ginger Shroom Journey
**Platform:** Unity | **Language:** C# | **Release:** Steam  
Ginger Shroom Journey is a fully released 2D adventure game built in Unity. I was responsible for core gameplay programming, level design, UI implementation, and optimization. Key contributions include:
- **Character movement & physics:** Implemented smooth movement and collision handling.
- **Interactable objects:** Developed event-driven interactions and environmental triggers.
- **Game UI:** Created menus, HUD elements, and polished UI interactions.
- **Steam integration:** Handled publishing processes and store presence.

## Ragdoll Plainly Perilous
**Platform:** Unreal Engine 5 | **Language:** Blueprints | **Release:** Itch.io  
A physics-based experimental game exploring ragdoll mechanics. My technical contributions include:
- **Player Movement Through Physics Simulation:** Created a responsive ragdoll character using Unreal’s physics system.
- **Environmental Interactions:** Developed physics-based obstacles and triggers.
- **Collision Handling:** Ensured stability in interactions between objects and the player.

## Million Miles Deep
**Platform:** Unreal Engine 5 | **Language:** Blueprints | **Release:** Itch.io  
A high-intensity 2D bullet hell game set on an alien ocean planet. My programming work included:
- **Enemy AI:** Designed enemy movement patterns and attack behaviors.
- **Projectile mechanics:** Implemented shooting logic and projectile lifespan handling.
- **UI & HUD:** Created Menus and Widgets.
- **Collision detection:** Optimized performance.

## Mysteries of Tupni
**Platform:** Unreal Engine 5 | **Language:** Blueprints | **Release:** Itch.io  
A third-person action-adventure dungeon crawler where I was responsible for level design and various programming tasks. My contributions included:

- **Level design & environment setup:** Created and structured key game environments, including dungeon layouts and interactive elements.
- **Interactive objects:** Designed and scripted interactables with widget displays, doors, and chests.
- **Inventory system:** Developed an interactive inventory system based on integrating:
  - **Item data structures:** Designed a structured inventory system using Unreal Engine's Data Tables to define item properties, such as item names, descriptions, stackability, and icons.
  - **UI integration:** Built inventory widgets that support:
    - **Drag-and-drop functionality** for moving items between slots.
    - **Tooltips** for detailed item information on hover.
    - **Filtering and sorting** based on item types (weapons, consumables, quest items).
    - **Persistent Inventory** across different game levels/environments.
  - **Item interaction mechanics:**
    - Implemented item pickup logic using trace detection and interaction events.
    - Designed item usage logic, supporting consumables, equippables, and stackable resources.
    - Worked on item dropping functionality, spawning world objects upon inventory removal.
- **Quest integration:** Structured objectives and NPC interactions to guide player progression.

## Doors n' Dice
**Platform:** Unreal Engine 5 | **Language:** Blueprints | **Release:** Itch.io  
A unique 2D platformer integrating elements of chance, where players roll dice to determine their path forward. My technical work involved:
- **Dice-based decision mechanics:** Implemented logic for randomized player choices.
- **Interactive door blueprints:** Developed dynamic doors with multiple outcomes (progression, traps, challenges).
- **Death and respawn system:** Created a system for handling hazards and player resets.
- **Enemy AI:** Scripted patrolling enemies and interactive hazards.
- **Game physics adjustments:** Refined player movement for better responsiveness.

## Additional Projects
Beyond these major projects, I have worked on several smaller games that reinforce different aspects of my programming expertise:

- **Crimson Eclipse** (Unreal Engine 5 | 2D Side-Scroller Horror): Implemented enemy AI, interactive environment elements, game logic, and dynamic HUD elements.
- **Escape Control** (Unreal Engine 5 | Top-Down Sci-Fi Shooter): UI Widget Construction & Blueprinting, Programming Menus.
- **Various Game Jams**: Participated in rapid prototyping cycles, experimented with new game mechanics, and collaborated on diverse projects with small to medium sized teams (3-10 people).

These projects exhibit my technical knowledge in Unreal Engine 5 and Unity, with exceptional skills in Blueprints, C#, game mechanics programming, UI development, and level design.
